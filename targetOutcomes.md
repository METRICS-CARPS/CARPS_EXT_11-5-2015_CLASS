## Article ID: EXT_11-5-2015

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section of Experiment 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Impurity and moral self-regard. Similar 2 × 2 ANOVAs using impurity and moral self-regard as dependent measures also revealed only a significant main effect of type of behavior. Participants in the inauthentic-behavior condition reported greater feelings of impurity (M = 3.56, SD = 1.86, 95% CI = [3.30, 3.85]) and lower moral self-regard (M = 2.90, SD = 1.50, 95% CI = [2.61, 3.16]) than did participants in the authentic-behavior condition (impurity: M = 1.51, SD = 1.29, 95% CI = [1.25, 1.78]; moral self-regard: M = 4.99, SD = 1.68, 95% CI = [4.72, 5.26]), F(1, 263) = 111.06, p < .001, ηp 2 = .30, and F(1, 263) = 115.25, p < .001, ηp2 = .31, respectively.
